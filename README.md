# Starlit
A 2D game space exploration game made with Unity. Allows players to program their ships.
   
Some of the assets I used to facilitate programming by the player are no longer supported by Unity, so I'm still working on that. Likewise, the game has the groundwork laid for the whole galaxy to exist within one scene (through layer occultation; to support a live economy as well as multi-player), but I'm still in the process of procedurally generating planets in a way that is consistent with the rest of the game's art. I'm enjoying that quite a bit, so it might be a while until I re-add player programming.
