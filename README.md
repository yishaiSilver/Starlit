# Starlit
A 2D game space exploration game made with Unity. Allows players to program their ships.

I'm still in the process of bringing everything over from my previous build (there were a lot of outdated files, so I figured I'd clean it up as I brought it to github). There's a lot missing right now, but I'll try my best to bring it over asap.

The starting point of the game.
